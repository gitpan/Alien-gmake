NAME

    Alien::gmake - Find or build GNU Make

VERSION

    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS

     use Alien::gmake;
     # GNU Make should now be in your PATH if it wasn't already
     
     my $gmake = Alien::gmake->exe;
     system $gmake, 'all';
     system $gmake, 'install';

DESCRIPTION

    Some packages insist on using GNU Make. Some platforms refuse to come
    with GNU Make. Sometimes you just want to be able to build packages
    that require GNU Make without having to check the version of Make each
    time. This module is for that. It uses the system provided GNU Make if
    it can be found. Otherwise it will download and install it into a
    directory not normally in your path so that it can be used when you use
    Alien::gmake. This way you can use it when you need it, but not muck up
    your environment when you don't.

METHODS

 exe

     my $gmake = Alien::gmake->exe;

    Return the "name" of GNU make. Normally this is either make or gmake.
